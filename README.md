# R Project Analysis

## Predicting the chances of a customer giving a positive response

## Project Overview
This ongoing project focuses on analyzing data using R to uncover significant trends and insights. 
A superstore is planning for the year-end sale. They want to launch a new offer — gold membership, that gives a 20% discount on all purchases, for only $499 which is $999 on other days. It will be valid only for existing customers and the campaign through phone calls is currently being planned for them. The management feels that the best way to reduce the cost of the campaign is to make a predictive model that will classify customers who might purchase the offer.The tools used for analysis include R and RStudio.

## Objectives
Work will aim to meet the following objectives; 
- To predict the likelihood of the customers giving a positive response. 
- To identify the different factors that affect a customer’s response.

## Questions to answer
The work will seek to answer the following questions;

- What is the likelihood of the customers giving a positive response?

- What are the factors that affect a customer’s response?

## Methodology
- Data import and preliminary inspection in R
- Data cleaning and preparation:
  - Handling missing values and outliers
  - Standardizing data formats
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
  - Using R's visualization libraries (ggplot2, etc.)
  - Summarizing key statistics
- Statistical Modeling:
  - Applying regression analysis and other relevant models
  - Interpreting model outputs
